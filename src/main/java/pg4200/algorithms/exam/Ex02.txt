Exercise 2:
File: Ex02.java
Write a class called “StudentMap” that implements the interface MyMap, from
org.pg4200.les05.MyMap. Using only basic data structures (arrays, trees), implement the
functionality as follows:
-
-
-
-
For each of the 10 digits, you will have a binary tree storing all the students whose
student id starts with that digit. The ordering within the tree will be based on the order
of the student ids.
The binary trees will be accessed from an ArrayList of length 10 (where the index of
each element of the array is the first digit of the student ids of the students in that tree).
The operations defined in the MyMap interface (put, get, delete) should maintain this
structure. This means that, when adding a new student to the map, the student should
be added in the appropriate position in the correct binary tree.
In addition, implement a method “Student getByName(String search_name)” that
returns the first student found whose first or last name matches the search_name
string.
See example below for a more visual understanding of the structure:
