Exercise 1:
File: Ex01.txt
a. Write a regular expression that matches archives names correctly for this exam. The
name of the file must begin with “pg4200” and must end with “zip”.
For example, your regular expression
should match: “pg4200_00000.zip”, “pg4200_12345.zip”
should NOT match: “pg4201_00000.zip”, “pg4200_ab000.zip”, “pg4200_00000.rar”,
“pg4200_00000zip”


b. Write a regular expression that matches sentences that are about the course (for
example, a filter for mattermost that only matches sentences when they are about the
course, and flags them for your attention).
In this case, a sentence is a collection of characters that ends with a punctuation mark
(full stop – ‘.’ , exclamation mark – ‘!’, or question mark – ‘?’). To be relevant, the
sentence must contain one or more of the words: algorithms, algdat, pg4200.
